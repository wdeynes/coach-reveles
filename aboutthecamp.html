<p><i>“In the end, it’s extra effort that separates a winner from second place. But winning takes a lot more
than that, too.<br>It starts with complete command of the fundamentals. Then it takes desire,
determination, discipline, and self-sacrifice. And finally, it takes a great deal of love, fairness and respect
for your fellow man. Put all these together, and even if you don’t win, how can you lose?” -Jesse Owens</i></p>
