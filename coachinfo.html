<h3>In his own Words</h3>
<p>Coach Revels’ Coaching Philosophy:<br />
“All my life I have been compelled to lead; be it in athletics or otherwise. Leadership is something that was birthed in me and has displayed itself throughout my life in many ways. Even as a child I always wanted to led, teach and help others reach their true potential. I truly believe that a person’s purpose can be found in their talents and passions. With that belief, I know teaching and leading is my purpose and as a coach I can exude these talents both on the field and as a role model. My philosophy is simple; ‘sports are played by teams made up of individuals that must sacrifice some personal goals for the greater good of all, while gaining something for themselves in the process.’ It is said that “there is no I in TEAM” and while I adhere to that ideology, I believe a team is made up of individual players who should all be respected and appreciated for the sacrifices they make. A coach should be an example of that sacrifice, and should be the most willing to sacrifice for those he or she coaches. True leadership is shown through example and giving what you are asking of those you lead to give. Being a pillar of stability on and off the field and a rock solid example of a program is the best way to show leadership to athletes. I am a great example of this type of leadership. I am an excellent coach and teacher and I care for each athlete respectfully and equally.”</p>
